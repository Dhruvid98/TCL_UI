# UI Using TCl command
Creating a user interface using TCL programming. Where we take an Excel sheet as input and provide output as data sheet.

Consider design data as any processor and text as the output of a data processor, which will give you a characterization of that processor. 

## Input of tcl box

## TCL box

## Output
* It will set the design name, set the output directory, sdc constraints. All infor present.
* Run synthesis and run timing

Basically will provide the process behavioral description as input. And we are generating output as a data sheet, results, or characterization of the process. And in between lies the tickle box/TCL interface that needs to process the input and give you the output.
