# TCL_UI
An unique User Interface (UI) that will take RTL netlist & SDC constraints as an input, and will generate a synthesized netlist & pre-layout timing report as an output. It uses Yosys open-source tool for synthesis
                                    and Opentimer to generate pre-layout timing reports.
